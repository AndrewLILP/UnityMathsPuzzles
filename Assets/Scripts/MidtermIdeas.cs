    // Konigsbergs Bridge Problem - create a game where you have to cross all bridges without crossing any twice.
    // - have open and closed bridges based on how many times they have been crossed - maybe open and closed doors 
    // - have a map with bridges and paths, where you can only cross each bridge once
    // - players could collect a token from each bridge they cross - this could reveal the full story of the maths problem - secret revealed when all bridges are crossed
    // - the seventh bridge could then explode. player progresses to level 2. 
    // - AI enemy could transform into a tour guide - MindsEye style (robots change from enemy to friendly)
